- which will be used by the system to translate our English written code (high level language) to Assembly language (Low level language).

2. [PyPy - written in Python](https://www.pypy.org/): uses just-in-time (JIT) compilation to translate Python code into machine-native assembly language, faster than CPython.
3. [Jython - written in Java](https://www.jython.org/): allows users to write programs in Python and compile them to Java bytecodes that run directly on a Java Virtual Machine, or JVM
4. [IronPy - written in .net](https://ironpython.net/): an implementation of Python on the . Net runtime, or CLR (Common Language Runtime).
