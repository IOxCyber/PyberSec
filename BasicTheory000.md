# Super Basic Concepts

## Datatypes: Fundamental Data Types

- Numberic: int, float, complex
- String: str
- Boolean type: bool.
- Sequence types: list, tuple, range.
- Set data types: set, frozenset
- Mapping data type: dict.
- Binary types: bytes, bytearray, memoryview.


### Immutable Datatypes:
- Numbers (Integer, Rational, Float, Decimal, Complex & Booleans) , Strings, Tuples & Stringfrozen set.

### Classes -> Custom types

### Specialized Data Types: Packages & Modules to add functionality.

### None:  Absence of Value!

###

### Operator Precedence:
- The order in which an expression is evaluated.
- Parentheses > Exponent > Unary (Plus, Minus) bitwise Not > Multi, Div, Floor, Modulo > Add & Sub > Bitwise shift Opr > Bitwise AND > XOR > OR > Comparisons, Identity, Membership operators > Logical NOT > AND > OR

### Associativity: 
- the order in which an expression is evaluated if it has multiple operators of the same precedence.
- Almost all the operators have **left-to-right associativity** means left one is evaluated first.








[^1]:Bytecode is computer object code that an interpreter converts into binary machine code so it can be read by a computer's hardware processor. The interpreter is typically implemented as a virtual machine (VM) that translates the bytecode for the target platform.
