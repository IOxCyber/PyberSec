## Basics 101

### Concepts:
1. Python is a dynamic and strongly typed object-oriented programming language.
2. Strong typing means that the type of a value doesn't change in unexpected ways. A string containing only digits doesn't magically become a number, as may happen in Perl, JS(Loosely typed). Every change of type requires an explicit conversion.
3. Dynamic typing means that runtime objects (values) have a type, unlike static typing where variables have a type.

### Object:
- Virtually every item of data in a Python program is `**an object of a specific type or class.**` eg. check the class of the object as `type(Obj)`. [More](https://realpython.com/python-variables/#object-references)

- Objects are Pythonâ€™s abstraction for data & is an instance of a Class.

 -`**Every object has an identity, a type and a value**` or `identity(address that the object eg. id(var) ), Type(kind of object eg. type(var) ), Value(value stored by the object print(var) ).

### Variable & Object:
9. A Python variable is a symbolic name that is a `**reference or pointer**` to an object. Once an object is assigned to a variable, you can refer to the object by that name.

### Function:
10. Functions `explicitly` return a value or object via the `return` keyword otherwise returns `None`.
11. **Default Argument** Values must be declare after **Non-Default Argument** in Functions.

12. A method in python is somewhat similar to a function, except it is associated with object/classes.

13. None (absance of value) like Null in other language.

14. Iterables: An Object/collection of items that can be iterable over. eg. list, dict, set, tuple, strings.


15. Remember to pass the default value after the Non-default arguments & use return statement to return value from a function.
