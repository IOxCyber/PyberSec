## Data Structure: 
- a way to organise(store/retrieve) the data in the memory.

## DS Types:
## Lists: 
a. Lists are ordered collections of items that can be of different types. They are mutable, which means you can modify their elements.

b. Tuples: Tuples are `similar to lists but are immutable`, meaning their elements cannot be changed once defined.

c. Sets: Sets are `unordered(can't access by Index)` collections of unique elements. They do not allow duplicate values.

d. Dictionaries: Dictionaries are `key-value pairs` that allow you to store and retrieve data based on unique keys. The keys are typically strings or numbers, and they provide fast access to values.

e. Arrays: Arrays are used to `store homogeneous data types in a contiguous memory block`. Unlike lists, arrays have a fixed size and can only contain elements of the same type.

f. Linked Lists: Linked lists are `linear data structures` consisting of nodes that store data and a reference to the next node in the sequence.

g. Stacks: Stacks follow the `Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)` principle, where elements are added and removed from the same end. It is similar to a stack of plates, where the last plate placed is the first one to be removed.

h. Queues: Queues follow the `First-In-First-Out (FIFO)` principle, where elements are added at one end and removed from the other end. It is similar to a queue of people waiting in line.

i. Heaps: Heaps are `binary trees that satisfy the heap property`. They are commonly used to implement priority queues, where elements with higher priority are dequeued first.

j. Trees: Trees are `hierarchical data structures with a root node and child nodes connected by edges`. They are used to represent hierarchical relationships between elements.

## Insight:
- `Every list indexed eg. li[0] item has its own address.`
- DS can have hetrogeneous type of data.
- `Ordered DS: Store in sequence in memory & accessed by index` unlike unordered DS.
- `lists, strings and tuples are ordered` collection of objects.
- `sets and dictionaries are unordered` collection of objects.
- Dictionary `keys must be immutable, Unique type i.e unchangeable.`
- Dictionary's duplicate key will be overwrite with latest value.
- `Set {values}: Unordered (Can't access by "Index"), Unique values, mutable`
- All the Data Structures are iterable in Python.
