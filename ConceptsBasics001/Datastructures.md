# Data Structure: 
> ### a way to organise(store/retrieve) the data in the memory.

# Insight:
- Every list indexed eg. li[0] item has its own address.

- DS can have hetrogeneous type of data.

- Ordered DS: Store in sequence in memory & accessed by index unlike unordered DS.

-  **lists, strings and tuples** are **ordered** collection of objects.
  
-  **sets and dictionaries** are **unordered** collection of objects.

- Dictionary **keys must be immutable** type i.e unchangeable.

- Dictionary's duplicate key will be overwrite with latest value, **Key has to be unique.**

- Set {values}: **Unordered** (Can't access by "Index"), **Unique values, mutable**
