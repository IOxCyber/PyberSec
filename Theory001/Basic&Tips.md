# Basics 101

### Concepts:
1. Python is a dynamic and strongly typed object-oriented programming language.
2. Strong typing means that the type of a value doesn't change in unexpected ways. A string containing only digits doesn't magically become a number, as may happen in Perl, JS(Loosely typed). Every change of type requires an explicit conversion.
3. Dynamic typing means that runtime objects (values) have a type, unlike static typing where variables have a type.

### Object:
4. Virtually every item of data in a Python program is **an object of a specific type or class.** eg. check the class of the object as type(Obj). [More](https://realpython.com/python-variables/#object-references)
5. Objects are Pythonâ€™s abstraction for data & is an instance of a Class.
6. Every object has an identity, a type and a value.
7. **id(x)** function to check memory address where x is stored.
8. **is** operator used to check the Object Identity. eg: A is B.

### Variable & Object:
9. A Python variable is a symbolic name that is a **reference or pointer** to an object. Once an object is assigned to a variable, you can refer to the object by that name.

### Function:
10. Functions **explicitly** return a value or object via the **return** keyword otherwise returns **None**.
11. **Default Argument** Values must be declare after **Non-Default Argument** in Functions.

### Class:

# Best Practice
1. Variables are written in snake_case, and constants usually in SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE.
